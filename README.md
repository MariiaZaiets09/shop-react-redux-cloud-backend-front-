### Local Testing

To test Lambda functions locally, we can use the Serverless Framework's `invoke local` command. 
This command allows us to invoke a function in our local environment, simulating the AWS Lambda 
environment. This can be helpful for testing and debugging our function without needing to deploy 
it to AWS.
